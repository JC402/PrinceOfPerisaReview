I thought the Prince of Persia game was interesting. I played it on the MS-DOS emulator at https://www.retrogames.cz/play_102-DOS.php. The music is very creative despite its technical limitations. The art too is expressive and gives the right vibe despite its simplicity. The gameplay, on the other hand, doesn't hold up as well. The player character is very hard to control since he takes mutliple steps with one press of the arrow keys. The mechanics of the game are not obvious too, like how you need to get a running start to leap over gaps. The game also sometimes tries to trick you by putting floor panels that fall when you walk over them. When you fall, you die, and have to start the level over from the beginning. It is a hard game, which some people might find enjoyable, but not me.
